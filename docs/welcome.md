Spotting satellites in the night sky can be a relaxing, rewarding activity. The serenity of contemplating the night sky, the thrill of catching a satellite passing by at 28,000kph.

## What does Satellite Tracking Involve?

1. The time at which you observe the satellite cross an imaginary line between two known stars
2. Your location on Earth when you made this observation (Latitude, Longitude, and Elevation)

Right now, timing a satellite is a relatively manual process and takes some practice. TruSat will continually add features to make this process easier and more enjoyable. You can be the first to know about new features by joining the TruSat Community. And please share your ideas for new features, and your tips for satellite spotting in the TruSat Forum.

If you’re new to the sport, don’t worry about trying to time a satellite on your first outing. We’ll walk you through a progression of activities to build your skills, familiarize yourself with the night sky, and enjoy yourself along the way.
